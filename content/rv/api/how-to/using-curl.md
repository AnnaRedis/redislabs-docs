You can access and use the API using a variety of tools:

### Swagger User Interface

The [Swagger UI](https://api-beta1-qa.redislabs.com/beta1/swagger-ui.html) is useful for initial introduction and learning about API operations, models and simulated usage via a web based user interface

TODO: add `Try now`


### Generating a client in your favorite programming language

Using [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) you can generate an API HTTP client in a variety of programming languages, or roll-your-own client by wrapping the API REST calls in a programming language of your choice.

**IMPORTANT:** 
* The code generated by Swagger Codegen (or a custom code wrapping the HTTP API calls) is not supported but Redis Labs ltd. 
* Redis Labs API supports only the HTTP layer of communication between a standard HTTP request and the API. 
* If any issues are encountered while interacting with the API, the raw HTTP call (URI, body and parameters) will be required by Redis Labs ltd. personnel in order to provide support and assistance.


### Using the `cURL` command-line HTTP client

`cURL` is a popular command line tool used to perform HTTP requests, in an ad-hoc manner, or within shell scripts (mostly Linux Bash). For an introduction to `cURL` see "[How to start using cURL and why: a hands-on introduction](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-start-using-cURL-and-why-a-hands-on-introduction-ea1c913caaaa)"


**The official API documentation uses `cURL` and Linux shell scripts to provide examples on using the API.**

For example, a standard API call to get System Log information looks like this in `cURL`:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://$HOST/logs" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "x-api-key: $ACCOUNT_KEY" \
    -H "x-api-secret-key: $SECRET_KEY" \
    | jq -r .
```

**Notes on the above example:**

1. The example expects several variables to be set in the Linux shell:
    * **`$HOST`** - the URI of the Redis Labs API. i.e. `api-beta1-qa.redislabs.com/beta1`
    * **`$ACCOUNT_KEY`** - the Account key value (see "[Enable your Account to use API]({{< relref  "/rv/api/how-to/enable-your-account-to-use-api.md" >}})")
    * **`$SECRET_KEY`** - the perosnal secret key value (see "[Create API Keys for your team]({{< relref  "/rv/api/how-to/create-api-keys-for-your-team.md" >}})")
1. The line "`| jq -r .`" means that the HTTP response will be piped (forwarded) to the `jq` JSON command line processor, and it will display only the raw output (`-r`) or the root element (`.`)
1. You can set the variables using a shell commands like the following:

```bash
export HOST=api-beta1-qa.redislabs.com/beta1
export ACCOUNT_KEY=Ap890...a7kzu
export SECRET_KEY=S6clcg...7fefh
```
