Initially, API access to your account is disabled. In order to enable such access perform the following steps:

1. Login to SM with a user that is an owner of its account.
1. Navigate to the "Settings" menu. 
1. In the "Account" tab, locate the property "Cloud API Access Key".
1. Click the button labeled "Generate" next to the label of the property.

The generated hash is the API access key, needed as a parameter in all API calls.
