Initially, API access to your account is disabled. In order to enable such access, you must login with a user that is an owner of its account.

Once you are logged in, navigate to the "Settings" menu. In the "Account" tab, locate the property "Cloud API Access Key".
If the account is not yet enabled for API access, a button labeled "Generate" appears next to the label of the property.
Click the button to generate a public access key and enable the account for API use.
